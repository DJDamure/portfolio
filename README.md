# Damure Portfolio

This repository contains a simple one-page website for the DJ and producer **Damure**. The site showcases upcoming gigs, contact information, and a small media section. There is no build step or external dependencies—everything can be viewed locally by opening the `index.html` file in a browser.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML document linking to the stylesheet and script
- `styles.css` – Styles for layout, fonts, and fade-in animations
- `script.js` – Small script that observes elements with the `fade-in` class and triggers animations as they enter the viewport
- `assets/` – Folder containing background and logo images

## Viewing Locally

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. If you prefer a local web server, any simple static server will work since there is no backend logic.

## Customization

Feel free to adjust the HTML, CSS, or images to suit your needs. The project is intentionally lightweight and does not rely on any frameworks or package managers.
